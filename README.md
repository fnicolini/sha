# Sha algorithms

These are extremely basic implementations of standard hashing algorithms  written from scratch based on the official
document(FIPS) published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). A copy of the document can be found in
this repository as pdf. They are intended as a programming exercise and are not by any mean cryptographically secure and
therefore should not be used in security-needing contexts.
